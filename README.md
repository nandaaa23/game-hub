## 🎮 Project Description

**Flail HUB** is a web-based hub of classic arcade games with a useless twist.  
We’ve thrown out perfectly good keyboard and mouse controls and replaced them with hand tracking, body movement, and voice commands.  

It’s less of a "game hub" and more of a **"flail hub."**

---

## ❓ The Problem (that doesn’t exist)

Gaming has become too efficient and comfortable.  
Players can sit for hours, silently achieving high scores with minimal physical effort.

This level of ergonomic perfection is, frankly, boring.  
Where’s the chaos? Where’s the accidental exercise?

---

## 🧪 The Solution (that nobody asked for)

**The Flail Hub!**

A collection of games that forces you to stand up, wave your arms, and yell at your computer.  
We’ve engineered a solution that transforms precise, skillful gameplay into an interpretive dance of impending failure.
